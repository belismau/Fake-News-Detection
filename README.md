# Fake News Detection
Web app built with React.js and Flask which presents a report about Fake News Detection with Logistic Regression and Ensemble Methods, together with the model (created with Jupyter Notebook for testing several input news).

## Installation

This web app has a client and a server. The client created with React is used to present the website and serve its routes. The client side is fetching /handlenews with the user input to send the information to Flask server, which uses the created model to return a result.

### Client

To run the web app (run it on http://localhost:3000), follow the steps below.

``` 
$ cd app 
```

``` 
$ npm install 
```

``` 
$ npm start 
```

### Server

To run the server (run it on http://localhost:3001), follow the steps below.

``` 
$ cd server
```

``` 
$ flask run --port=3001
```
